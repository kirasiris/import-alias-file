# First Step

```
npm i import-alias-file
```

## Description

This npm library eases the process of importing files within a nodejs project.
The way it works it's similar to NextJS!.

I made it after getting tired of using `../` multiple times when I needed to use a function that was placed in a different file!

## Usage

```js
const lookFile = require("import-alias-file");

const Url = lookFile("@/folder/folder/file");
```

This library is still too young. I accept any help you guys can provide. The goal is to make the functionality NextJS uses into NodeJS. Please feel free to share your knowledge!
